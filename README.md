# Subtle Text

This is a chrome extension (that you might install on a friend's unattended, unlocked laptop ...) 
that will perform innocuous spelling and usage manipulations on text content in the browser. The kind
of changes that will make them wonder if they're seeing things.

It works in vanilla javascript to avoid pulling down any large libraries.

It will provide a couple of configurable modes including --
    * random letter duplication
    * random word duplication
    * increased spelling errors
    * more ???
